<h2>Description</h2>
<hr>


S is for the flagships, A is the mid tier, M is the entry level - this appears to be the new SAMsung order of things (spot the N in there for the Note?). The Ms themselves are very tightly spaced - we have the Galaxy M20 today to see how it compares to the M10 from last week and whether it will help Samsung's aggressive charge in the affordable segment.

Going over the specs, the Galaxy M20 is already looking a lot nicer than the M10 - a snappier Exynos, a higher-res display, a ton more battery, and a fingerprint sensor where there was none. Add to that a more reasonable 3/32GB base model (vs. the M10's limiting 2GB/16GB), more megapixels on the selfie cam, and some fast charging, and it's starting to become evident that the savings are not quite worth going for the M10.
It's not all top marks for the Samsung Galaxy M20, however, and you'll need to look at the M30 for things like an AMOLED display and 4K video recording (with the same chipset as on the M20, mind you), plus less essential stuff along the lines of a depth camera on the back or even higher-res selfies.

<br><br>

The Samsung Galaxy M20, much like the smaller M10, has an all plastic construction which doesn't look or feel all too premium. But then the M-series make no claim for upmarket build - on the contrary, affordability is key here. With that in mind, the M20 is well put together and we didn't experience any creaks or squeaks or the like.

<br><br>

On the other hand, the smooth glossy finish of the back welcomes fingerprints and keeps them there. A texture of some sort could have helped, but there's none. There's also not much choice in terms of colors - it's either the Ocean Blue of our review unit or the Charcoal Black that's about as attractive as what it's named after.

For all its relative durability in the event of a drop when compared to glass, the plastic back of the Galaxy M20 is prone to scratching. We did try to baby these units we have on loan, but when we packed the M20 to send it back there were some fine scratches on the rear - nothing major, but still there if you look closely.
No need to look closely to spot the cameras - the two modules are behind a shared window in the top left corner. The main shooter is on the bottom, the ultra wide up top, accompanied by a flash under them.

One of the major advantages of the Galaxy M20 over the Galaxy M10 is the fingerprint reader, right here on the back too. It's oval-shaped as opposed to circular, but while the shape isn't all that important, the relatively high placement could be an issue for those with average or shorter fingers. We found ourselves not quite reaching it when holding the phone naturally. Perhaps you'll get used to the needed stretch after enough use, but a slightly lower position certainly would have helped. Maybe the battery just got in the way?
Whether it's the battery to thank or not, we're certainly appreciating the fact that the speaker isn't ported on the back like it is on the M10 - the bottom-firing speaker of the Samsung Galaxy M20 can't be blocked when the phone is left on a table.
<br><br>

Other improvements to note on the Galaxy M20's bottom when comparing to the M10 is the USB-C port - the M10 is stuck in the past, the M20 is keeping up. Of course, the 3.5mm jack remains, and the primary mic completes the list of things to be found around here.

Continuing the tour, we find the hardware buttons on the right - the power button a little above the midpoint, the volume rocker above it. We found no issues with the ergonomics of these, all is well.

On the opposite side is the card slot and the very long tray that pulls out from it can take two nano SIMs and a microSD - points to the Galaxy M20 for having a dedicated memory slot. The M10 has the same tri-slot setup, but the Galaxy M30 actually employs a shared slot for the microSD and the second SIM - though that one comes with 64GB of storage by default.<br><br>

Dual camera on the back
On paper, the Samsung Galaxy M20 shares its camera setup with the M10 and that means a 13MP primary camera, and a 5MP ultra wide angle secondary one. The main shooter has a 1/3.1" sensor with 1.12µm pixels and a narrow-ish 31mm-equivalent lens with an f/1.9 aperture and phase-detect autofocus. The ultra-wide's 5MP are stretched over a 120-degree field of view, which translates to around a 12mm equivalent focal length.

The camera app will be familiar to anyone who's picked up a Samsung phone in the past couple of years. Side swipes work for changing modes, while swiping up and down toggles between the front and rear cameras. There's a camera selector with the self-explanatory tree designation for switching between the main and ultra wide modules on the back.

The row of icons above the shutter button includes a cog wheel for accessing settings, an aspect ratio selector that toggles the full view mode (because who doesn't want 19.5:9 photos), flash mode selector, filter bank, and a front/rear toggle if you're not into the gesture-based solution.

Inside the settings menu you get access to the usual stuff: resolutions for stills and video, an HDR setting (Auto/On/Off), grid lines, the lot. The timer setting is here, while a more accessible viewfinder icon makes more sense in our book (also that's how it is on the S10). There's even a watermark option, which we accidentally flipped on and shot the samples that way, prompting a reshoot afterwards.<br><br>

Image quality
Photos taken on the Galaxy M20 are okay, when you keep in mind its price and competition. Noise is well controlled (though still present), there's decent detail, and images are sharp across the frame.
Colors are a bit muted, uncharacteristically so for a Galaxy phone, but not really to the point of being an issue. Dynamic range isn't stellar either, but if you manage your expectations properly and appreciate where the Galaxy M20 stands, you should be happy with the output.<br><br>

The 5MP ultra-wide camera isn't a detail champ but it does reasonably well. Dynamic range is pretty limited and on top of that the shots are very distorted. Even so, we think it's nice to have an ultra wide cam, distorted as it may be, plus you could love it precisely for that look.</p>
